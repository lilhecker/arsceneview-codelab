In this CodeLab, you will make a AR app with SceneView that loads a 3D model on an Augmented Image

This repository contains the template used for the tutorial in Group Assignment for COMP3330 Group 26 (Members: Zhu Suying/Wong Man Lok/Su Wei Cheng/Ho Man Ho)

The following branches of the codelab represents different steps:

* `main`, the starting point of the Codelab;
* `step-choose-augmented-image`, corresponding to the code that you should have at the end of slide 13;
* `step-add-to-database`, corresponding to the code that you should have at the end of slide 14;
* `step-load-model`, corresponding to the code that you should have at the end of slide 15;

Use `git checkout step-choose-augmented-image`, `git checkout step-add-to-database` or `git checkout step-load-model` to check out the next steps.
